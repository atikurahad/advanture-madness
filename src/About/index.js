        An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically
        bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with some potential
        for physical danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain
        climbing, scuba diving, river rafting or participating in extreme
        sports.
